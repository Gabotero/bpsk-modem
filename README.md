# BPSK Transmitter and Receiver for PlutoSDR

This repository contains a basic implementation of a BPSK transmitter and receiver designed for use with the PlutoSDR platform. The code enables simple packet transmission and reception, including flow synchronization using a defined sync word.

## Overview

- **Transmitter**: Generates BPSK modulated signals based on input bit sequences or text.  
  **Note:** The transmitter is very simple and needs polishing. I believe there is a sharp discontinuity at the end of the packet because I just repeat the samples, which may cause some "noise" in the IQ constellation.

- **Receiver**: Performs BPSK demodulation, including synchronization using a predefined sync word to handle basic packet framing.

## Background and Source

This project is based on the code by Paulo Dutra (PU4THZ) from this post:

### Bug Fix

I corrected a bug in the original implementation that caused the Mueller-Muller loop to lose lock of the timing synchronization, adversely affecting the stability and accuracy of the receiverâ€™s timing recovery. This fix improves the robustness of the synchronization and packet handling.

## Usage

The code is intended to be used with PlutoSDR hardware. It provides a foundation for experimenting with BPSK modulation and demodulation with packet synchronization.
